# landing-page
The task given by The Odin Project was to create a landing page following the picture example provided. For this task I had to start from scratch coding the html and the css by using what I've learnt in previous lessons and googling anything I did not know. Font size, font family and font weight was provided by The Odin Project alongside color schemes. I used several pictures which I will credit to their respective owners.
